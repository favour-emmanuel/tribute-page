            I will dearly miss Steve Jobs he inspired me to keep getting the
            iphones I have loved them ever since the first one. Steve Jobs was a
            great man and a awesome CEO for APPLE. He has inspired me to one day
            and go for and work with the apple when I get old but my dream is to
            own Apple and follow by Steve Jobs way and make Apple greater than
            before it was. But I will dearly miss Stve Job he's a great man and
            I will never firget him

          <p>
            What impact has Steve Jobs had on my life? Every short story i've
            written as an adult (and certainly every one that has been
            published), almost every email I've ever written, has been written
            on machines creted by Apple. I interacted online using an Apple
            machine long before I ever encountered a PC. Steve Jobs helped to
            realized the Star Trek futeure I dreamed of as a kid. And throught
            his viso=ion, I have been realize my own. You'll be missed, Mr.
            Jobs. Thanks for all your amazing work.

            Dear Apple I was deeply saddened to hear about the death of Steve
            Jobs, the great leader and creator in the world. I believe he would
            go to a more beautiful place and he would like to see a stronger
            Apple. We will remember him forever.
